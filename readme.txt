= API Usage =

Please know that the generating or updating of a single comparison set will require between 2 and 6 API requests. If you are using the API **Starter Plan**, consider [upgrading](https://datafeedr.me/dashboard) to the **Basic Plan**.

= Plugin Installation =

1. Upload the `datafeedr-comparison-sets` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the *Datafeedr Comparison Sets* plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Configure here: WordPress Admin Area > Datafeedr API > Comparison Sets.

= Enabling Amazon Products =

If you want Amazon products to appear in your comparison sets, do the following:

1. Go here WordPress Admin Area > Datafeedr API > Configuration > Amazon Settings.
1. Add your Amazon Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Tracking ID and Locale.
1. Click the [Save Changes] button at the bottom of the page.
1. Go here WordPress Admin Area > Datafeedr API > Comparison Sets.
1. Change the **Cache Lifetime** field to `86400`.
1. Click the [Save Changes] button at the bottom of the page.

1. Check the **WooCommerce** option.
1. Click the [Save Changes] button at the bottom of the page.

Now, when a product in your store is viewed for the first time, a price comparison set will be generated.

*Note: Enabling WooCommerce integration will not generate price comparison sets for all products in your store immediately. Sets will only be generated when the product is viewed for the first time.*

= Display Comparison Sets using Shortcodes =

To display comparison sets in your posts, pages or in other areas where WordPress shortcodes are allowed, use the formats below.


Create a price comparison set using name field:
`
[dfrcs name="baratza encore"]
`

Create a price comparison set using name and brand field:
`
[dfrcs name="j8006" brand="omega" ]
`

Create a price comparison set with a custom title:
`
[dfrcs name="chaos harness" brand="black diamond" title="{num_products} great deals on Black Diamond Chaos Harnesses"]
`

**Available Filters**

You can further filter the results of a Comparison Set by using the `filters` attribute. Available filters are:

`
currency
amazon_locale
image
onsale
direct_url
saleprice_min
saleprice_max
finalprice_min
finalprice_max
merchant_id
source_id
`

Here is what each filter controls:

`
// Return only products which are priced in USD.
currency=USD

// Return Amazon products from US Locale.
amazon_locale=US

// Return only products that have an image.
image=1

// Return only products that are on sale.
onsale=1

// Return only products that have a direct URL.
direct_url=1

// Return only products with a minimum sale price of $10.
saleprice_min=10

// Return only products with a maximum sale price of $100.
saleprice_max=100

// Return only products with a minimum final price of $20.
finalprice_min=20

// Return only products with a maximum final price of $200.
finalprice_max=200

// Return only products from merchants with specific Merchant IDs (merchant_id).
merchant_id=61316,33092,97391

// Return only products from networks with specific Network IDs (source_id).
source_id=126,3
`

Merchant IDs `merchant_id` (MID) and Network IDs `source_id` (NID) can be referenced on our [Affiliate Networks & Merchants page](https://datafeedr.me/networks).

Here are some examples of how to use these filters in your shortcodes:

Create a price comparison set using `onsale` filter:
`
[dfrcs name="farpoint 55" brand="osprey" filters="onsale=1"]
`

Create a price comparison set using currency filter:
`
[dfrcs name="aeropress coffee maker" brand="aerobie" filters="currency=USD"]
`

`
[dfrcs name="nomad 20 solar panel" filters="currency=USD&finalprice_max=400"]

`
[dfrcs ean="737416080066"]
`

`
[dfrcs asin="B07BN6KH6W"]
`

Create a price comparison set using an UPC code:
